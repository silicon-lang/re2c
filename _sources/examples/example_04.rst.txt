Multiple blocks
---------------

This example demonstrates the use of multiple interrelated ``/*!re2c ... */`` blocks.
We pick a deliberately simple task (parsing integers),
so that all complexity is associated with relations between blocks and not with the lexical grammar.

Notes:

* Configurations and definitions (lines 20 - 26) are not scoped to a single re2c block â€” they are global.
  Each block may override configurations, but this affects the global scope.
* Blocks don't have to be in the same function: they can be in separate functions or elsewhere
  as long as the exposed interface fits into the lexical scope.

Compile:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ re2c -o multiple_blocks.cc multiple_blocks.re
    $ g++ -o multiple_blocks multiple_blocks.cc

Run:

.. code-block:: bash
