A basic example
---------------

Here is an example program :download:`[syntax.re] </manual/syntax/syntax.re>`
that shows various aspects of re2c syntax:

.. literalinclude:: /manual/syntax/syntax.re
    :language: cpp

Run re2c as ``re2c -W syntax.re -o syntax.c`` (option ``-W`` enables warnings).
The generated code :download:`[syntax.c] </manual/syntax/syntax.c.txt>`
looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: /manual/syntax/syntax.c.txt
    :language: c

The lines without comments correspond to the code generated by re2c. Not all
comments are present in the output --- only those which are in C/C++ code, and
not inside of re2c blocks.
